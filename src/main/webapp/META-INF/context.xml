        BN: This file will be used by tomcat to create a deployment xml for the war file created for this project.
        See this on C:\Users\[home]\AppData\Roaming\NetBeans\7.3.1\apache-tomcat-7.0.34.0_base\conf\Catalina\localhost
        
        To use a single application as if it is duplicated for every client, create an new xml file that point to the single 
        app war file on the docBase path and put the valve details for it (make sure that its access path is unique). 
        Finally just place the xml file in the file $CATALINA_HOME\conf\Catalina\localhost\  and tomcat will auto deploy 
        provided autoDeploy is set to true (see next comment).
        
        In order to allow auto-deployment using your just created deployment xml file, first make sure that the server Hot
        autoDeploy property is set to true e.g. autoDeploy="true".
        
        To update the single app and apply for every virtual instance running, remove the single app jar and replace with the
        newly updated one and RESTART TOMCAT. (Note: You might want to inform your app owners that you will perform maintenance lol)       
        
        NB: If the unpackWARs attribute is true in the server.xml, the web application archive file will be expanded to a directory of the same name 
        (without the ".war" extension".)
        Note: If you re-deploy an updated WAR file while Tomcat is stopped, be sure to delete the associated expanded directory before restarting Tomcat, so that the updated 
        WAR file will be re-expanded when Tomcat restarts. (During development with Netbeans IDE for example, the IDE does all that for us but
        on production, find a way to do this.)
        
        The following line will produce a log detail for any activity request received on the springdata app
